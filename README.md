# Note To Self
A lightweight framework proposing tools and methodologies that encourage cataloguing fleeting thoughts, ideas, and emotions as they are.

### Introduction
The words we keep are more than records of the past; they are signals to our future selves. Note to Self is a space for capturing fragile and fleeting thoughts holding them in trust, lightly, yet with care.

You know, the Word created everything man ever was. And in the age of Images, the value of the Word has never been more indispensable. It’s often said that ours is an age of “happy pictures, sad people.” I believe it is not necessarily that we are sad within the Images we’ve created, but rather that Images alone are not enough to hold us in harmony with the underlying language that gave rise to consciousness—and ultimately to us. Images are an abstraction of what the Word first created.

In our most recent breakthroughs with large language models, scientists have quickly realized that LLMs generate more than just text. We’re discovering emergent properties that arise from language itself. Today, models can generate Images, video, even biomorphic organisms—new forms of expression rooted in the Word.

### Design Principles
1. **Simplicity** - Capturing a thought should never get in the way of the thought itself.
2. **Authenticity** - Notes remain true to the user; no algorithms or filtering self-expression.
3. **Privacy** - What is written belongs to the writer; trust in privacy is absolute.
4. **Continuity** - Notes are not just records, but touchstones to revisit, reflect on, and grow with over time.

### Proposed Implementation
WIP

### Closing Thoughts
A note to self is more than an entry in an app, it’s a conversation across time. It’s the self we are today reaching toward the self we are becoming.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
